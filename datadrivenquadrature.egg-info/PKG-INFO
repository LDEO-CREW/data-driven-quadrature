# datadrivenquadrature

Data Driven Quadrature is a Python package for quadrature-based integration point selection. In many applications, integrals over high-resolution integration axes are calculated repeatedly and can be extremely computationally expensive. This operation can be simplified by selecting integration points and corresponding weights that approximate the integral (Gaussian quadrature). 

This package implements a linear-programing approach to this optimization problem with a simple user-interface.
